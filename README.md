# Final-Project-YifanLi
Summary:
For my final project, I made a class searching system just for all undergradate computer sciense class. First thing you can do is to print everything out. I have nine part for evert class by couse ID, course number,class name, teacher's name, place, rate, time, recommended and level. Instead of printing them all out, you can print them by these category also. 

How to run this program:
You can download these five files from github, and you can open them in Xcode. Then they will run.
